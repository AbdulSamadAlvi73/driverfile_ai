            <p>The company listed above (the “Company”) may request an investigative consumer report about you from HireRight, Inc. (“HireRight”), a consumer reporting agency, in connection with your employment or application for employment (including independent contractor or volunteer assignments, as applicable).  An “investigative consumer report” is a background report that includes information from personal interviews (except in California, where that term includes background reports with or without information obtained from personal interviews), the most common form of which is checking personal or professional references through personal interviews with sources such as your former employers and associates, and other information sources.  The investigative consumer report may contain information concerning your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, mode of living, or credit standing.  You may request more information about the nature and scope of an investigative consumer report, if any, by contacting the Company. </p>
            <p class="text-decoration-underline">Ongoing Authorization:  </p>
            <p>If the Company hires you or contracts for your services, the Company may obtain additional consumer reports and investigative consumer reports about you without asking for your authorization again, throughout your employment or your contract period, as allowed by law.  </p>

I understand that if the Company hires me or contracts for my services, my consent will apply, and the Company may, as allowed by law, obtain from HireRight (or from a consumer reporting agency other than HireRight) additional background reports pertaining to me, without asking for my authorization again, throughout my employment or contract period.   </p>

            <p>I understand that information contained in my employment (or contractor or volunteer) application, or otherwise disclosed by me before or during my employment (or contract or volunteer assignment), if any, may be used for the purpose of obtaining and evaluating background reports on me.

I further acknowledge that I have received additional state law notices that I have reviewed and read. </p>
